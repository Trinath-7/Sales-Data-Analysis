# Retail Sales Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project performs a basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a small sample of retail sales data to uncover key sales metrics, performance trends, and customer insights.

## Files in this Folder
1.  **`retail_data.csv`**: The raw transactional sales data.
2.  **`retail_analysis.ipynb`**: The Python script (Jupyter Notebook) containing the analysis code, data cleaning, transformations, and visualizations.

## Analysis Performed
* **Key Metrics**: Calculated Total Sales and Average Transaction Value.
* **Category Performance**: Identified top-performing product categories by total revenue.
* **Regional Breakdown**: Visualized sales distribution across different regions.
* **Time Series**: Transformed the date to analyze monthly sales trends.

## How to Run the Analysis
1.  **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python installed with the `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` libraries.
2.  **Place Files**: Make sure both `retail_data.csv` and `retail_analysis.ipynb` are in the same folder.
3.  **Run Notebook**: Open the `retail_analysis.ipynb` file in a Jupyter environment (e.g., VS Code with the Jupyter extension) and run all cells.
